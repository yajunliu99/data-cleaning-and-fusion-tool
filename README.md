# Project Description

Data Cleaning and Fusion Tool

The tool is designed to enhance the accuracy and usability of traffic microsimulation models by enabling high-fidelity bottleneck identification, route choice analysis, and model calibration. It provides transportation practitioners with a practical and efficient way to clean and fuse diverse data inputs. It aims to advance simulation-based decision-making by improving data handling processes.

# Prerequisites

No formal installation is required.
